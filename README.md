# Java Application to Implement Bank Functionality

The Java program developed here is to implement bank functionality using OOP. The user can create an account, get balance info, withdraw money, deposit, and also get all account information. At first, I created the interface called MainBank to do a few operations mentioned above. Then I created three subclasss Personal, Deposit, and Cerdit that extend the class Account. Also, I created a class Driver to invoke all the methods.
